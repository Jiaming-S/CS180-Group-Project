Testing classes:
We created basic JUnit tests to ensure that UserEntry, MessageEntry, and UserDatabase worked as expected. We did not test any "corner cases" or unconventional uses of the classes as we have not implemented the ability to handle those yet.

We have a basic main method contained in Runner.java that allows us to test database access. It will be greatly revised in the future as we implement networking, concurrency, and GUI.
